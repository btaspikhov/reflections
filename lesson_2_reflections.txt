What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a hidden directory .git to store repository files within.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporal storage place for files currently being worked upon. 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can keep on staging any small changes to the code until I reach the point of when change is big enough to represent a
logical change. 
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It's cruicial for easy navigations through branches.
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
In the result we end up having a single branch with commits from both the branches. Last commit is going to have
two parents and contains changes made in both of them since parting in two branches. Diagram shows it clearly
that two branches merging in one.
