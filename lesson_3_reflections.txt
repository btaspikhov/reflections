When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When working from different computer or collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may be in the process of updating my file in a local machine and may not last remote commit to be present on the
    branch. A remote repository could be the main one and local repository not neceserally having all the commits (f.e.,
    several people working on a project).

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a clone of remote repository in GitHub. Clone is a copy of repository from either GitHub or local machine. Branch is a series of commits in repository.
    Fork has a reference to its author, so good to use letting that know to other people. Cloning is needed for creating a copy of repository whether on local 
    machine or remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can merge commits into the master branch and then push it back to remote repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Via files exchange with comments. Using Git is offcourse a lot easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
